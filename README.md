This repo contains some scripts for generating crack propagation jobs on Abaqus CAE software.

The crack propagation is being investigated with the LEFM method (Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics)

i) The first model is a rectangular matrix reinforced with inclusions (circular, elliptical, mixed).
   The crack propagation is happening into the rectangular matrix.
 
 
ii) The second model is a T-shape Structural Metallic fillet along with a rectangular bottom part
    as a support to the upper T-shape fillet. The crack propagation is being investigated as the
    shape of the bottom support part is changing.
